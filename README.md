- a simple NodeJS and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server

- a recycling collection points [API with data](https://data.primariatm.ro/dataset/puncte-de-colectare-a-deseurilor-voluminoase-sticle-haine-si-a-uleiului-utilizat/resource/d0134630-84d9-40b8-9bcb-dfdc926d66ab?view_id=b69fea38-f593-4d23-85ed-af8804bafee0) provided by the city hall office:
